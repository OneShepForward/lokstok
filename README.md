LokStok Inventory System is my capstone project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering course. It is a full-stack web application with a ReactJS frontend and Ruby on Rails backend.

The use case for LokStok is for a warehouse to track its inventory more effectively, rendering QR Code stickers that can later be scanned when an employee is checking an item out of the storeroom to remove it from the inventory and apply it to a job.
